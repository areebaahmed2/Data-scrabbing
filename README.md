# 🎯 Data Scrubbing Project - Student Exam Help Data

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on **data scrubbing** where I collected and cleaned data of students looking for help in their online exams.  
The data was **scraped from Reddit** using Python tools and stored in a **CSV file** for further analysis.

The main goal of this project was to:
- Practice **data collection** from real-world platforms.
- Apply **data scrubbing/cleaning** techniques to handle raw, unstructured text.
- Prepare the dataset for potential **analysis or insights**.
